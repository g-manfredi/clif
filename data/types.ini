; two coordinate systems: world, virtual plenoptic camera

; for simplicity the rotation vector is scaled by pi/2 e.g (0 0 1) is a 90° rotation around z axis
; normally world is specified with x,y as floor and z as heigth
; camera with x, y parallel to imaging plane, and positive z into the world
; example: plenoptic camera 500 mm from world origin along y axis (in world coordinates) respectively along z axis (in camera coordinate system)
